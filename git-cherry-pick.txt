git cherry-pick command takes a commit from somewhere else, and "play it back" wherever you are right now.
Here is an article that explains basic idea behind it: http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/rebase-from-the-ground-up/cherry-picking-explained.html

Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces, recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).

When it is not obvious how to apply a change, the following happens:

1. The current branch and HEAD pointer stay at the last commit successfully made.
2. The CHERRY_PICK_HEAD ref is set to point at the commit that introduced the change that is difficult to apply.
3. Paths in which the change applied cleanly are updated both in the index file and in your working tree.
4. For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions, as described in the "TRUE MERGE" section of git-merge[1]. The working tree files will include a description of the conflict bracketed by the usual conflict markers <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>.
5. No other modifications are made.

Actually, part or all of the SHA for the commit could be used as a parameter for the command.

---------------------------------------
Actual steps, that have been taken:

1.  git fetch
	git checkout <remote branch>

2.  git cherry-pick <older-commit-sha> ... <newer-commit-sha>
or  git cherry-pick <one-particular-commit-sha>

3.  git push origin <remote branch>
